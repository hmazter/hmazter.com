My name is Kristoffer, I'm 32 and residing in Stockholm Sweden. I've
have done five and a half year of study at Royal Institute of Technology
(KTH) with major in Computer Science. As of April 2011 I work full time
as a software developer at [Linas
Matkasse](http://www.linasmatkasse.se).

From time to time I write in this blog, I host code
at [GitHub](https://github.com/hmazter) and may write some
[tweet](https://twitter.com/hmazter).
