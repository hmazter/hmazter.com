My name is Kristoffer, I'm 32 and residing in Stockholm Sweden. I've
have done five and a half year of study at Royal Institute of Technology
(KTH) with major in Computer Science. As of September 2018 I work full time
as a software developer at [Workbuster](https://www.workbuster.com/).

From time to time I write in this blog,
I host code at [GitHub](https://github.com/hmazter)
and may write some [tweet](https://twitter.com/hmazter).
