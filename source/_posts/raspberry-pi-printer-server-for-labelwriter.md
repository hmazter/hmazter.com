Introduction
------------

So I have finally come around and started playing with a Raspberry Pi.
If you dont know what it is, its a one card arm mini computer, read more
at [raspberrypi.org](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). What i tried to
accomplish here was to get the pi to work as remote accessible printer
server for a Dymo LabelWriter 450.

The goal was to build a web application that could be used from a tablet
and on a click on a button in the webapp ui send a request to the pi
with a number of paramterers that would for two labels and be printed.
The whole thing used a a checkin system for children whit a label for
the child and the parent dropping of the child.

Overview
--------

After some thouhts i desicided to build the system with the following
components and parts:

-   Dymo LabelWriter 450
-   Raspberry Pi, model B with Rasbian Wheezy
-   Apache server (with PHP) on the raspberry reciving the printing
    requests
-   C++ application on the raspberry doing the actual printing

Getting the printer up and running
----------------------------------

### Install cups libraries and other necessary libraries to build

```bash
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get install libcups2-dev libcupsimage2-dev g++ cups cups-client
```

### Download Dymo SDK and install the drivers

Download the Dymo LabelWriter SDK for Linux located
at <http://sites.dymo.com/DeveloperProgram/Pages/LW_SDK_Linux.aspx>

```bash
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ wget http://download.dymo.com/Download%20Drivers/Linux/Download/dymo-cups-drivers-1.4.0.tar.gz
```

Now we need to unpack, configure and install the drivers. This is done
with the autoconfigure file that is packed with the sdk. Change
directory to the unpacked foleder and run ./configure

```bash
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ tar xvf dymo-cups-drivers-1.4.0.tar.gz
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ cd dymo-cups-drivers-1.4.0.5/
pi@raspberrypi ~/dymo-cups-drivers-1.4.0.5 $ sudo ./configure
pi@raspberrypi ~/dymo-cups-drivers-1.4.0.5 $ sudo make
pi@raspberrypi ~/dymo-cups-drivers-1.4.0.5 $ sudo make install
```

That is everything to get the drivers for the printers installed on the
system.

### Add the printer

To use the printer, we need to add it in the system first, this is
easiest done with cups webadmin. And since the raspberry is only
aceessed remote with ssh, we need to install a command line based web
browser , I'm using links2. You could use the graphical interface as
well. But since the rasperry is going to be a embedded system i'll do
everything with command line.

```bash
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get install links2
```

And the we need to add the pi user to the printer admin group to be
allow to login to the printer admin.

```bash
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo usermod -a -G lpadmin pi
```

Navigate to http://localhost:631/admin with links2

```bash
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ links2 http://localhost:631/admin
```

![cups admin](/media/2013/05/cups_amin.png)  
Select "Add printer".

![cups login](/media/2013/05/cups_login.png)   
Log in with pi user. Default user *pi* and password *raspberry*.

![cups local printers](/media/2013/05/cups_local_printers.png)   
In the list of local printers, the "Dymo LabelWriter 450" should appear, mark and continue.

![cups add printer](/media/2013/05/cups_add_printer.png)   
Give printer a name and description, and continue.

Select the Dymo LabelWriter 450 drivers if found. otherwise you need to
locate the file that *make install* created earlier.

![cups manage](/media/2013/05/cups_manage.png)   
That should be everything for the printer. To verify, go the admin interface
and click Manage Printers ant the LabelWriter should appear in the list.

The Code
--------

### The printing application

So I built the printing application in c++ from the example code
supplied by DYMO.  
The includes used for the application, some standard c++ libraries and
the cups libraries:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cups/cups.h>
#include <cups/ppd.h>
#include <string>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <map>
#include <exception>
```

This code lists all printers and can be useful to see if your program
can find the LabelWriter.

```cpp
int i;
cups_dest_t *dests, *dest;
int num_dests = cupsGetDests(&dests);
for (i = num_dests, dest = dests; i > 0; i --, dest ++)
{
  if (dest->instance)
    printf("%s/%s\n", dest->name, dest->instance);
  else
    puts(dest->name);
}
```

The actual printing does not require that much code. *PrinterName* is a
string with the name of the LabelWriter you chose when you added it
before. *ImageName* is a string with image to be printed, for me it's a
png image that is generated by the web server in the next section.

```cpp
int num_options = 0;
cups_option_t* options = NULL;

num_options = cupsAddOption("PageSize", "w167h288", num_options, &options);
num_options = cupsAddOption("scaling", "100", num_options, &options);
cupsPrintFile(PrinterName, ImageName, "Print Label", num_options, options);
cupsFreeOptions(num_options, options);
```

The options for the PageSize parameter can be found in the lw450.ppd
file (/dymo-cups-drivers-1.4.0.5/ppd/lw450.ppd). It lists all paper
types and sizes available for that printer.

### Compiling

For compiling the application these flags is used:

```bash
g++ `cups-config --cflags` PrintLabel.cpp `cups-config --libs` -o PrintLabel
```

### The receiving HTTP server

The web server, running apache with PHP, is just used
for receiving remote calls with parameters and generate an image and
then execute the previous c++ application  to print that image.

```php
<?php
$firstname = $_GET['firstname'];
$id = $_GET['id'];
$fileName = "kid_".$id.".png";
//... (image generation with GD and write image to disk) ...
$printOutput = array();
exec("./PrintLabel " . $fileName, $printOutput, $status);
```
